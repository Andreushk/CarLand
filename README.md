# CarLand

CarLand is a service that allows you to receive and manage data on the technical characteristics of cars. In this work, I put the emphasis on working with Node.js. The beauty of the layout and its adaptability was not a priority in this work.

To run the code, you need to use the npm start command in the terminal to start the local server. After this command, you can run index.html and test.
